----> Employee Hierarchy with Inheritance & Polymorphism <-----
>>>>>Problem Statement<<<
Design a class hierarchy in Java to represent different types of employees in a company. 
All employees share common attributes and behaviors, but specific roles like Manager and Developer have specialized methods.
Your task is to:
- Create a base class Employee with common fields like name, id, and a method 'calculateSalary()'
- Create subclasses Manager and Developer that inherit from Employee.
- Override the 'calculateSalary()' method in each subclass to reflect role-specific logic.
- Add specialized methods:
	- Manager: conductMeeting()
	- Developer: writeCode()
- Use polymorphism to call 'calculateSalary()' on different employee types.

"Sample Input"
Enter employee type (Manager/Developer): Developer
Enter name: Arjun
Enter ID: 102
Enter base salary: 50000


"Expected Output"
Employee Type: Developer
Name: Arjun
ID: 102
Calculated Salary: 55000.0
Developer is writing code...
