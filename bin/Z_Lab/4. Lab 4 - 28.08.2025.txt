>>>Designing a Personalized Art Certificate System:<<<
Riya, a freelance graphic designer, tracks her client 
projects using a simple system. Each project has a 
title, client name, number of design revisions, and a 
fixed base fee. If the number of revisions exceeds 3, 
she charges ₹500 per extra revision.

Design a class ProjectInvoice with the following:
- Instance variables: title, clientName, numRevisions, baseFee
- Constructor to initialize all fields
- Method calculateTotalFee() that returns the total fee based on the revision logic
- Method getProjectSummary() that returns a formatted String like:
   "Client: ABC Corp | Project: Logo Design | Total Fee: ₹7500"
Write a test class ProjectInvoiceTest to create two project objects and display their summaries.
