Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter their name, age, and city. The program should use a class called "UserProfile" that demonstrates:
- A default constructor that initializes the user details with default values.
- An overloaded constructor that accepts user input and sets the values accordingly.
- A method displayDetails() that prints the user information in a formatted way.
- Validate that age is a positive integer.
