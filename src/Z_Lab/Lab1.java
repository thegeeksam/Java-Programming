/**
 * * This file is part of the Java Programming Lab project.
 * * Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter their name, age, and city. The program should use a class called "UserProfile" that demonstrates:
- A default constructor that initializes the user details with default values.
- An overloaded constructor that accepts user input and sets the values accordingly.
- A method displayDetails() that prints the user information in a formatted way.
- Validate that age is a positive integer.

Sample Input: 1
Enter your name: Hariharan
Enter your age: 15
Enter your city: Pollachi

Sample Output: 1
User Details:
Name: Hariharan
Age: 15
City: Pollachi

Sample Input: 2
Enter your name: Hariharan
Enter your age: -5
Invalid age. Please enter a positive number.
Enter your age: 15
Enter your city: Pollachi

Sample Output: 2
User Details:
Name: Hariharan
Age: 15
City:Â Pollachi
