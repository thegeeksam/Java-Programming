 * Threads:-
 * Multiple threads run at same time in a code.

 * - They can run parallel.
 * - Multiple threads can share resources.

 * - Runnable State  -> start() method

 * Through notify(), you will go to waiting state to runnable state.
 * From Running, Runnable state to dead state through stop() method.
