/*
 * throws keyword is used to declare an exception. 
 * It gives an information to the programmer that there 
 * may occur an exception, so it is better for the programmer
 * to provide the exception handling code,
 * so that normal flow can be maintained.
 * 
 * Exception Handling is mainly used to handle the checked exceptions. 
 * 
 * If there occurs any unchecked exception such as 
 * "IndexOutOfBoundException",it is programmers fault that 
 * he is not performing check up before the code being used.
