 * * A static block is executed once when the class is loaded 
 * * into memory—before main() or any object is created.
 * * It is ideal for
 * * - Initializing static variables
 * * - Loading configuration files or resources
 * * - Performing setup tasks that should run only once
 * *
 * * This Java snippet illustrates:
 * * - Declares 2 static variables: radius and area.
 * * - These belong to the class, not to any instance.
 * * - As soon as the class is loaded into memory, static block runs.
 * * - It sets radius = 4 and calculates area = 16.
 * * - The message "Invoked java static block!" confirms the block's execution
